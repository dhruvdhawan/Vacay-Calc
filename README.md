## FAQ

### Does this give me the exact number of days I can take for my vacation?
No. This is an estimate based on your regularly scheduled shifts and does not account for missed shifts (e.g., illness) or extra shifts picked up.

### What if I am casual?
Casual workers do not accrue vacation and are paid in lieu of benefits.

### How close is the estimate?
It depends. Factors like wage rate increases or carried-over vacation banks can affect accuracy. If the "Available Vacation Hours" matches exactly (e.g., 22 hours for 2 shifts), you might be slightly short.

### I am going into my X year of continuous service. Doesn't that mean I accrue more vacation?
The calculator uses your current vacation accrual percentage, which remains the same until July 1. If your vacation is scheduled after July 1, you may accrue at a higher rate after that date.
